## Hardware design
This branch of the Lulu project is using a 200mA power LED with current current circuitry.
As the project is focussing on embedded electronics we chosed an high power LED ; OSRAM OSLON SX seeking 200 mA/h 
Then it can be 5 hour of autonomy with a 1000 mA Lypo battery.
The LED is also providing a narrow angle (60°) this helps to focus the light in to the optic fiber wafer.
    See datasheet: https://github.com/eTextile/Lulu/blob/master/Hardware/DOCs/LY_CN5M.pdf
The brass tube connector have been selected to fit the outer diameter of the LED optics.
The PCB triangle shape have been selected to fit the zero waste production process.
All the components are SMD package to reduce the size and price of th PCB.
We have been experiencing a new way to hand solder the LED on the edge of the PCB but it is still not so handy.
Custom tooling will be designed and tested to help in that soldering process.

## Lulu-MCU Powering
The Lulu-MCU board must be powered with a voltage betwin 3.3V to 5V.
DO NOT USE 3V single coin battery - voltage is too low and it will not work for long.
Prefer the use of rechargeable Lipo battery with small Lipo charger.

**R2** is used to set the current limit and this doesn't depends on the voltage supply VDD.
**Q1** is used as a variable resistor. **Q1** starts out turned on by **R1**.
**T1** is used as an over-current sensing switch, and **R2** is the "sense resistor" that triggers **T1** when too much current is flowing.
The main current flow is through the LED's, through **Q1**, and through **R2**.
When too much current flows through **R2**, **T1** will start to turn on, which starts turning off **Q1**. Turning off **Q1** reduces the current through the LED's and **R2**.
So we've created a **feedback loop**, which continuously tracks the current and keeps it exactly at the set point at all times.
The NPN transistors **T1** have a specified 0.6V drop between base and emitter when on.
This means the voltage across their respective shunt resistors **R2** will always be 0.6V.
According to Ohm’s law, this means that the current through them will be '0.6 V / 2.7 Ohm', or about 222mA.

## TODO
- [ ] Add ATTiny10 ont the KiCad desin
- [ ] Add POGO PINs on the PCB to flash the ATTiny10
- [ ] Change the PCB shape to put the tube angle to 90° from the e-Textile bus
- [ ] cool ref: https://hackaday.io/project/179554-tinyicoc
